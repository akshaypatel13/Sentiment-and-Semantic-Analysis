# Sentiment-and-Semantic-Analysis
*CSCI-5308 Data Management, Warehousing and Analysis Individual Project*

The content management system that performs analysis to identify Key Performance Identicators(KPI) to improve the business, education, lifestyle and safety in the Halifax region. The project focuses on implementing big data infrastructure and processing data extracted from Twitter, News API and OpenMovie Database against specified keywords. The Analyst engine was built to public and private services using sentiment and semantic analysis for the Halifax Region with extracted data stored in MongoDB. The Cleaned data was used to determine the polarity of the Tweets based on the keywords using SparkContext and Map Reduce Distributed Computing. The Semantic Analysis was performed on the data extracted from News API against contextual phrases, keywords to fetch relevant information and compare that against prior experience.
